## Overview
This project is a Denim Tears-inspired e-commerce website built for a school project. It features a product listing page with interactive elements such as navigation and a shopping experience.

## Features
- Dynamic product listing using `fetch`.
- Three event listeners for interactive elements:
  1. Clicking on a product's "Buy Now" button triggers an alert.
  2. Clicking the "Shop" link displays a welcome message.
  3. Clicking the "Contact" link displays an email contact alert.
- Hover effects and smooth UI styling.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – The main HTML structure.
- `style.css` – Styling for the website.
- `index.js` – JavaScript for interactivity and data fetching.
- `db.json` – Mock database containing product details.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Ensure a local server is running if using `fetch` for `db.json`.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a shopping cart.
- Add a search/filter feature.
